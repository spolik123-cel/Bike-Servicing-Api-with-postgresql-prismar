## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/spolik123-cel/Bike-Servicing-Api-with-postgresql-prismar.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd Bike-Servicing-Api-with-postgresql-prismar
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up your PostgreSQL database**:
   - Create a new database in PostgreSQL.
   - Update the `.env` file with your database connection details.

5. **Run migrations**:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

6. **Start the server**:

   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

Your API should now be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL. Below are some examples of how to use the API.

### Example Request

To create a new bike service record:

```http
POST /api/services
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "customerId": 1,
  "bikeId": 2,
  "serviceDate": "2023-10-01",
  "details": "Full service including brake check."
}
```

### Example Response

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "customerId": 1,
  "bikeId": 2,
  "serviceDate": "2023-10-01",
  "details": "Full service including brake check."
}
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint                | Description                           |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| GET    | /api/customers          | Get all customers                     |
| POST   | /api/customers          | Create a new customer                 |
| GET    | /api/bikes              | Get all bikes                         |
| POST   | /api/bikes              | Create a new bike                     |
| GET    | /api/services           | Get all service records               |
| POST   | /api/services           | Create a new service record           |

## Error Handling

The API includes robust error handling. If a request fails, the API will return a meaningful error message along with the appropriate HTTP status code. 

### Example Error Response

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Customer not found",
    "status": 404
  }
}
```
